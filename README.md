## User Story

- As a passenger, I want to be able to easily search for and book my e-tickets online without having to visit a physical ticketing office or wait in long lines at the airport.

- The system should validate the input and show an error message if any of the fields are invalid or empty.

- When searching for flights, I want to be able to specify my preferred travel dates, departure and arrival cities, and departure and arrival dates and times.

   I also want to be able to filter my search results based on the airline, departure, and arrival times, and ticket prices.
 
- Once I have selected my preferred flight, I also want to be able to select any additional services such as extra baggage allowance.

- The payment process should be simple and secure such as credit/debit card payment method.

   After the payment is completed, I want to receive an e-ticket confirmation via SMS.

- The system should show the flight details such as airline, flight number, departure and arrival time, and baggage allowance for each flight option.

- In case of any changes to my travel plans, I should be able to easily cancel my reservation online.

- If I need to cancel my reservation, I want to be able to do so easily online and receive a refund according to the airline's cancellation policy.

- Overall, I want the online e-ticket reservation system to be user-friendly and efficient, allowing me to quickly and easily book my flights,

   make changes if necessary, and receive timely updates about my itinerary.
